Shifting through memory, and in concert with the themes of his novel On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, Vuong contends with personal loss, the meaning of family, and the cost of being the product of an American war in America. At once vivid, brave, and propulsive, Vuong’s poems circle fragmented lives to find both restoration as well as the epicenter of the break. The author of the critically acclaimed poetry collection Night Sky With Exit Wounds, winner of the 2016 Whiting Award, the 2017 T. S. Eliot Prize, and a 2019 MacArthur fellow, Vuong writes directly to our humanity without losing sight of the current moment. These poems represent a more innovative and daring experimentation with language and form, illuminating how the themes we perennially live in and question are truly inexhaustible. Bold and prescient, and a testament to tenderness in the face of violence, Time Is a Mother is a return and a forging forth all at once.","ISBN_10":"0593300238","ISBN_13":"9780593300237","pageCount":128,"imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dcqZPEAAAQBAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dcqZPEAAAQBAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d5\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api"},"amazonPrice":9.99,"amazonRating":4.5},{"id":"WB9oEAAAQBAJ","title":"The Candy House","authors":["Jennifer Egan"],"publisher":"Simon and Schuster","publishedDate":"2022-04-05","description":"Named a Most Anticipated Book of the Year by Time, Entertainment Weekly, Vogue, Good Housekeeping, Oprah Daily, Glamour, USA Today, Parade, Bustle, San Francisco Chronicle, Seattle Times, The Boston Globe, Tampa Bay Times, BuzzFeed, Vulture and many more! From one of the most celebrated writers of our time, a literary figure with cult status, a “sibling novel” to her Pulitzer Prize- and ​NBCC Award-winning A Visit from the Goon Squad—an electrifying, deeply moving novel about the quest for authenticity and meaning in a world where memories and identities are no longer private. The Candy House opens with the staggeringly brilliant Bix Bouton, whose company, Mandala, is so successful that he is “one of those tech demi-gods with whom we’re all on a first name basis.” Bix is 40, with four kids, restless, desperate for a new idea, when he stumbles into a conversation group, mostly Columbia professors, one of whom is experimenting with downloading or “externalizing” memory. It’s 2010. Within a decade, Bix’s new technology, “Own Your Unconscious”—that allows you access to every memory you’ve ever had, and to share every memory in exchange for access to the memories of others—has seduced multitudes. But not everyone. In spellbinding interlocking narratives, Egan spins out the consequences of Own Your Unconscious through the lives of multiple characters whose paths intersect over several decades. Intellectually dazzling, The Candy House is also extraordinarily moving, a testament to the tenacity and transcendence of human longing for real connection, love, family, privacy and redemption. In the world of Egan’s spectacular imagination, there are “counters” who track and exploit desires and there are “eluders,” those who understand the price of taking a bite of the Candy House. Egan introduces these characters in an astonishing array of narrative styles—from omniscient to first person plural to a duet of voices, an epistolary chapter and a chapter of tweets. If Goon Squad was organized like a concept album, The Candy House incorporates Electronic Dance Music’s more disjunctive approach. The parts are titled: Build, Break, Drop. With an emphasis on gaming, portals, and alternate worlds, its structure also suggests the experience of moving among dimensions in a role-playing game. The Candy House is a bold, brilliant imagining of a world that is moments away. Egan takes to stunning new heights her “deeply intuitive forays into the darker aspects of our technology-driven, image-saturated culture” (Vogue). The Candy House delivers an absolutely extraordinary combination of fierce, exhilarating intelligence and heart.","ISBN_10":"1476716765","ISBN_13":"9781476716763","pageCount":352,"averageRating":4.5,"imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dWB9oEAAAQBAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003dWB9oEAAAQBAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d5\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api"},"amazonPrice":9.99,"amazonRating":4.5},{"id":"gTOMzgEACAAJ","title":"The Paris Apartment","authors":["Lucy Foley"],"publisher":"William Morrow","publishedDate":"2022-02-22","description":"Jess needs a fresh start.

Your family has been attacked, never again to be the same. Now you have to choose between law…and justice. Jason Bennett is a suburban dad who owns a court-reporting business, but one night, his life takes a horrific turn. He is driving his family home after his daughter’s field hockey game when a pickup truck begins tailgating them, on a dark stretch of road. Suddenly two men jump from the pickup and pull guns on Jason, demanding the car. A horrific flash of violence changes his life forever. Later that awful night, Jason and his family receive a visit from the FBI. The agents tell them that the carjackers were members of a dangerous drug-trafficking organization - and now Jason and his family are in their crosshairs. The agents advise the Bennetts to enter the witness protection program right away, and they have no choice but to agree. But WITSEC was designed to protect criminal informants, not law-abiding families. Taken from all they know, trapped in an unfamiliar life, the Bennetts begin to fall apart at the seams. Then Jason learns a shocking truth and realizes that he has to take matters into his own hands. Sometimes justice is a one-man show.","ISBN_10":"0525539670","ISBN_13":"9780525539674","pageCount":400,"averageRating":4.5,"imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d4KRPEAAAQBAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d1\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api","smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id\u003d4KRPEAAAQBAJ\u0026printsec\u003dfrontcover\u0026img\u003d1\u0026zoom\u003d5\u0026edge\u003dcurl\u0026source\u003dgbs_api"},"amazonPrice":9.99,"amazonRating":4.5},{"id":"GKVPEAAAQBAJ","title":"The Midnight Library","authors":["Matt Haig"],"publisher":"Penguin","publishedDate":"2020-09-29","description":"The #1 New York Times bestselling WORLDWIDE phenomenon Winner of the Goodreads Choice Award for Fiction | A Good Morning America Book Club Pick | Independent (London) Ten Best Books of the Year \"A feel-good book guaranteed to lift your spirits.\"—The Washington Post The dazzling reader-favorite about the choices that go into a life well lived, from the acclaimed author of How To Stop Time and The Comfort Book.
